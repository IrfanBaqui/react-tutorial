## Step by step guide to React

 There are many React tutorials out there. This one is different. I teach you about the entire build process and introduce redux and a server, but everything progressively.

 Most React tutorials out there start out with a heavy boilerplate code. Not this one. This starts out extremely bare-bones, and we build on top of it every iteration. This way you know exactly what each dependency is.

 My approach in this tutorial is to teach you through branches. The branch names are 'step1', 'step2' ... and the description is below.


### Index

* Step 1: Building a bare-bones react project using WebPack
* Step 2: Add Hot Module Reloading and switch to ES2015
* Step 3: Introduce state and containers and making the calculator functional
* Step 4: Advanced state management without React Router. Added transaction history.

### Build Process

 ```
 npm install
 npm run build-dev
 npm run start
 ```
